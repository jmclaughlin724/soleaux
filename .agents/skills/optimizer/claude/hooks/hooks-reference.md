### Configuration Locations

| Location                        | Scope          | Shareable |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json`       | All projects   | No        |
| `.claude/settings.json`         | Single project | Yes (VCS) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json`   | Single project | No        |
| Skill or agent YAML frontmatter | While active   | Yes       |

## Hook Types

### Command (`type: "command"`)

| Field           | Required | Description                        |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `command`       | Yes      | Shell command to execute           |
| `timeout`       | No       | Seconds (default: 600)             |
| `async`         | No       | Run in background (default: false) |
| `once`          | No       | Run once per session (skills only) |
| `statusMessage` | No       | Custom spinner message             |

### HTTP (`type: "http"`)

JSON POST to a URL endpoint. Available for a subset of events.

| Field     | Required | Description                          |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `url`     | Yes      | Endpoint URL                         |
| `headers` | No       | HTTP headers (supports `${ENV_VAR}`) |
| `timeout` | No       | Seconds (default: 600)               |

Requires `allowedHttpHookUrls` in settings to whitelist URLs. Use `httpHookAllowedEnvVars` to control which env vars can appear in header interpolation.

### Prompt (`type: "prompt"`)

Single-turn LLM yes/no evaluation. Response: `{ "ok": true }` or `{ "ok": false, "reason": "..." }`.

### Agent (`type: "agent"`)

Multi-turn subagent with tool access (Read, Grep, Glob). Same response schema as prompt hooks.

## Matcher Patterns

| Event | Matches Against | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, etc. | Tool name | `Bash`, `Edit\|Write`, `mcp__github__.*` |
| `PermissionDenied` | Tool name | `Bash`, `Edit\|Write`, `mcp__github__.*` |
| `Setup` | Init/maintenance phase | `init`, `maintenance` |
| `SessionStart` | How started | `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`, `fork` |
| `UserPromptExpansion` | Command name (empty = every slash command) | `commit`, `review` |
| `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop` | Agent type | `general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, custom names, plugin-scoped `^my-plugin:reviewer$` |
| `PreCompact`, `PostCompact` | Compaction type | `manual`, `auto` |
| `ConfigChange` | Config scope | `user_settings`, `project_settings`, `local_settings`, `policy_settings`, `skills` |
| `Elicitation`, `ElicitationResult` | MCP server name | `my-mcp-server` |
| `StopFailure` | Error type | `rate_limit`, `authentication_failed`, `server_error` |
| `FileChanged` | Literal filenames | `.envrc\|.env` |
| `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted` | Not supported | Always fires |
| `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove` | Not supported | Always fires |
| `PostToolBatch`, `MessageDisplay`, `CwdChanged` | Not supported | Always fires |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | Load reason | `session_start`, `nested_traversal`, `path_glob_match`, `include`, `compact` |
| `Notification` | Notification type | `permission_prompt`, `idle_prompt`, `auth_success`, `elicitation_dialog`, `elicitation_complete`, `elicitation_response`, `agent_needs_input`, `agent_completed` |
| `SessionEnd` | How ended | `clear`, `resume`, `logout`, `prompt_input_exit`, `bypass_permissions_disabled`, `other` |
| `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop` | Not supported | Always fires |

## Input and Output

Every hook receives via stdin: `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `permission_mode`, `hook_event_name`, and `effort` (object). `effort.level` is one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` — the active session effort level exposed to every hook event.

### Exit Codes

| Exit Code | Meaning | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Success | Proceed. stdout parsed for JSON |
| 2 | Blocking error | **Per-event** — see the "Can Block?" column above |
| Other | Non-blocking | Continue. First stderr line shown in the transcript as `<hook> hook error`; full stderr in the debug log |

Exit 2 is not universally blocking. On the events marked No it does something else: `PostToolUse` and `PostToolUseFailure` show stderr to Claude but the tool already ran; `PermissionDenied` ignores it because the denial already happened; `StopFailure` and `InstructionsLoaded` ignore output and exit code entirely; `MessageDisplay` displays the original text; and `Notification`, `SubagentStart`, `SessionStart`, `Setup`, `SessionEnd`, `CwdChanged`, and `FileChanged` show stderr to the user only. `WorktreeCreate` is the opposite case: **any** non-zero exit fails worktree creation.

### Decision Control

| Events | Pattern | Key Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, etc. | Top-level `decision` | `decision: "block"`, `reason` |
| `PreToolUse` | `hookSpecificOutput` | `permissionDecision`: `allow`, `deny`, `ask`, or `defer`. Across multiple hooks the most restrictive wins, in the order `deny`, `defer`, `ask`, `allow` |
| `PermissionRequest` | `hookSpecificOutput` | `decision.behavior` (allow/deny) |
| `PermissionDenied` | `hookSpecificOutput` | `retry: true` lets the model retry the denied tool call |

## Hooks in Skills and Agents

Defined in YAML frontmatter, scoped to component lifecycle. For agents, `Stop` hooks auto-convert to `SubagentStop`.

```yaml
---
name: secure-operations
hooks:
  EventName: # One of 30 hook events
    - matcher: "regex" # Optional filter
      hooks:
        - type: command|http|mcp_tool|prompt|agent
          command: "..." # command type
          url: "..." # http type
          prompt: "..." # prompt/agent types
          timeout: 60 # seconds (optional)
---
```

**Example:**

```yaml
---
name: secure-operations
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/security-check.sh"
  Stop:
    - hooks:
        - type: prompt
          prompt: "Check if all security validations passed: $ARGUMENTS"
---
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Available In | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | All hooks | Project root directory |
| `$CLAUDE_EFFORT` | All hooks | Active session effort level (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`); same value as `effort.level` |
| `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` | SessionStart | File path to persist env vars |
| `$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` | All hooks | `"true"` in remote web environments |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS` | SessionEnd | Timeout for SessionEnd hooks (default: 1.5s) |

## Best Practices

**Security:** Quote shell variables, validate inputs, check for path traversal, use absolute paths.

**Performance:** Keep hooks fast, use `timeout`, use `async: true` for long tasks, use `once: true` for one-time setup.

**Reliability:** Test manually with piped JSON, check `stop_hook_active` in Stop hooks to prevent loops, use `claude --debug`.

**Generated surface sync:** Register the canonical edit matcher in both `PostToolUse` and `PostToolUseFailure` so that a failed tool call still triggers the sync. Keep the sync command synchronous so mirrors are current before the next model call.

**Exec form for Node entrypoints:** When a hook references `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` or any path placeholder, use exec form (`"command": "node", "args": ["${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/..."]`) rather than shell form (`"command": "node \"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/...\""`). Exec form avoids shell interpretation of the path and is the upstream-preferred shape for path-templated hooks. Shell form is correct for package-manager shims (`pnpm`, `supaschema`) that need bin resolution.

**Response contract:** When a hook returns `hookSpecificOutput`, verify every field name against this reference before deploying. Unrecognized fields cause silent "hook error" — the hook exits 0 but the output is dropped. Use `updatedInput` (not `modifiedInput`), `permissionDecision` (not `decision`), and match the exact nesting documented under Decision Control and Input Modification.

**Repo hook closeout:** Claude registration lives in `.claude/settings.json` and Claude decisions live in `.claude/hooks/**`. Codex registration lives in `.codex/hooks.json`, while each directly registered handler or true executable owns its platform decision. An event owner may validate and parse once and evaluate narrow policy modules deterministically when its matcher covers several policies; modules never read stdin or emit platform decisions, and pure stdin-forwarding adapters remain prohibited. Execute the actual owner with representative root and nested-directory JSON, verify native denial, exit-`2` operational failures with empty stdout and bounded corrective stderr, and silent-success contracts, and run `pnpm hooks:test`. See `.codex/hooks/AGENTS.md` for Codex routing.

**Response-evidence boundary:** Response-evidence hooks must record command evidence only for recognized verification domains. Source and inventory reads such as `sed`, `cat`, file reads, and ad hoc inspection commands are context gathering, not verification evidence. Outcome parsing must trust structured status/exit fields or execution-status lines only; arbitrary stdout, stderr, transcript, or source text such as `process.exitCode = 2` must not create failed verification evidence.

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Event | Type | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-format after edits | `PostToolUse` | command | `formatter --write` |
| Block destructive commands | `PreToolUse` | command | Deny `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE` |
| Verify task completion | `Stop` | prompt | LLM evaluates if tasks done |
| Sync generated mirrors | `PostToolUse` | command | Refresh `.agents/**` or `.codex/**` after a canonical `.claude/**` edit |
| Skill enforcement | `UserPromptSubmit` | command | Prepend `/skill` commands |
| Log commands for audit | `PostToolUse` | command | Append to log file (async) |

## Prompt-Based Hooks (`type: prompt`)

Single-turn LLM yes/no decision. The hook sends context to a lightweight model that returns `{ "ok": true }` or `{ "ok": false, "reason": "..." }`. No tool access — pure evaluation.

```yaml
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: prompt
          prompt: "Is this bash command safe and repo-scoped?"
          model: haiku
```

Use prompt hooks for fast gate checks where the decision is binary (approve/reject) and no file exploration is needed.

## Agent-Based Hooks (`type: agent`)

Multi-turn subagent with tool access (Read, Grep, Glob). The agent can explore the codebase, run multiple tool calls, and reason across turns before returning its decision. Same response schema as prompt hooks.

```yaml
hooks:
  Stop:
    - hooks:
        - type: agent
          prompt: "Review changes and verify tests pass before allowing completion."
```

Use agent hooks when verification requires reading files, searching code, or multi-step reasoning that a single prompt cannot accomplish.

## SubagentStart / SubagentStop Events

- **SubagentStart**: Fires when a subagent spawns. Use to inject context, set environment variables, or log agent creation. Cannot block.
- **SubagentStop**: Fires when a subagent completes. Use to prevent premature stop, verify output quality, or enforce completion criteria. Can block (exit 2 forces the agent to continue).

The matcher for both events matches the **agent type**, never a tool name — see the matcher table above for accepted values.

Note: When an agent defines a `Stop` hook, it automatically converts to `SubagentStop` when that agent runs as a subagent.

## Agent Team Hooks

Three hook events fire inside an agent team. Exit code 2 behaves the same way (block + send feedback) for the two task hooks, but **`TeammateIdle` inverts the convention** — exit 2 keeps the teammate _working_ instead of idling. Getting this backwards turns a quality gate into an infinite loop.

| Event | Fires when | Exit 2 effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TeammateIdle` | Teammate is about to go idle | Teammate **keeps working** and receives stderr as feedback |
| `TaskCreated` | A task is being created on the shared task list | Prevents creation; stderr returned as feedback |
| `TaskCompleted` | A task is being marked complete | Prevents completion; stderr returned as feedback |

None of the three support matchers — they always fire. The feedback written to stderr is routed back to the lead or the teammate that triggered the event.

Common use:

- `TeammateIdle` — require the teammate to re-verify tests, update the task list, or confirm its hypothesis before being allowed to idle.
- `TaskCreated` — enforce task naming rules or block out-of-scope task creation.
- `TaskCompleted` — enforce a DoD (tests green, diff posted, no `TODO`) before a task counts as done.

## Enhanced Matcher Patterns

| Pattern | Matches | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple string | Exact tool name | `Bash` |
| Pipe-separated | Any of the listed tools | `Edit\|Write` |
| Regex | Tool names matching pattern | `mcp__supabase_main__.*` |
| MCP tool matching | Any MCP server tool | `mcp__github__.*` |
| Spawn matching | Agent type for SubagentStart/SubagentStop | `Explore`, custom agent names |

MCP tool names follow `mcp__{server}__{tool}`, so `mcp__supabase_main__.*` matches all Supabase MCP tools. A plugin-bundled server uses `mcp__plugin_{plugin}_{server}__{tool}`, matched as `mcp__plugin_my-plugin_db__.*`. [`subagent-mcp.md`](../agents/subagent-mcp.md) owns the naming and scoping forms; hook `matcher` fields take bare tool names, not the parenthesized permission-rule format.

## Decision Types

Hook exit codes and output fields control the decision:

| Decision | How to Signal | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| allow | Exit 0 | Proceed with the action |
| deny | Exit 2 | Block the action; stderr shown to Claude |
| ask | Escalate to user via `decision` | Prompt the user for manual approval |

For `PreToolUse`, use `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` with values `allow`, `deny`, or `ask`. For `PermissionRequest`, use `hookSpecificOutput.decision.behavior`.

## Input Modification

`PreToolUse` hooks can modify tool input before execution by returning `updatedInput` in `hookSpecificOutput`. The hook receives the original tool input via stdin and can return transformed input in stdout.

Include `hookEventName` and `permissionDecision` alongside `updatedInput`. Claude Code validates `hookSpecificOutput` with a strict Zod schema — missing `hookEventName` causes silent validation failure where the hook exits 0 but the output is dropped.

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "updatedInput": {
      "command": "echo 'modified command'"
    }
  }
}
```

`updatedInput` replaces the entire tool input object. Preserve all original fields you want to keep, not just the ones you are modifying. Use jq object update to replace a single field while keeping the rest:

```bash
printf '%s' "$INPUT" | jq --arg v "$MODIFIED" '
  {
    hookSpecificOutput: {
      hookEventName: .hook_event_name,
      permissionDecision: "allow",
      updatedInput: (.tool_input | .field_to_change = $v)
    }
  }
'
```

The field name is `updatedInput`, not `modifiedInput`. Using the wrong field name causes a silent "hook error" — the hook exits 0 but Claude Code cannot interpret the response, so the input modification is dropped.

This enables patterns like command rewriting, path normalization, prompt injection, or argument modification without blocking the tool call.
