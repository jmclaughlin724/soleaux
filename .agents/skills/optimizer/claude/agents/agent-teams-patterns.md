# Agent Teams Patterns

Patterns for orchestrating Claude Code agent teams - coordinated multi-session instances with shared tasks, inter-agent messaging, and team leads. Based on official documentation at [code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams).

> Related: [dynamic-workflows.md](../prompting/dynamic-workflows.md) covers single-session JS workflow orchestration (`/workflows`, `ultracode`), distinct from multi-agent teams.

> **Experimental:** Agent teams require `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` enabled in settings.json or environment.
>
> **Behavior baseline:** this file describes agent teams as of v2.1.178. With `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` set, a team forms when the first teammate is spawned — there is no setup step — and the shared directories are cleaned up automatically when the session exits. The `TeamCreate` and `TeamDelete` tools no longer exist.

## Subagents vs Agent Teams

Choose based on whether workers need to communicate with each other.

| Dimension | Subagents (`Agent` tool) | Agent Teams |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Context** | Own window; results return to caller | Own window; fully independent |
| **Communication** | Report back to main agent only | Teammates message each other directly |
| **Coordination** | Main agent manages all work | Shared task list with self-coordination |
| **Best for** | Focused tasks where only result matters | Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration |
| **Token cost** | Lower: results summarized back | Higher: each teammate is separate Claude instance |
| **Session** | Runs within parent session | Independent Claude Code session |
| **Persistence** | Dies when parent completes | Persists until explicitly shut down |
| **File access** | Same working directory | Same working directory (or worktree-isolated) |

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Use Subagents | Use Agent Teams |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quick parallel research (3-5 min tasks) | **Yes** | No |
| Independent file changes, no discussion needed | **Yes** | No |
| Teammates need to share findings mid-task | No | **Yes** |
| Competing hypotheses requiring debate | No | **Yes** |
| Cross-layer coordination (FE + BE + tests) | Possible | **Better** |
| Budget-conscious, routine tasks | **Yes** | No |
| Complex feature requiring collaboration | No | **Yes** |
| Sequential pipeline (A feeds B feeds C) | **Yes** | Overkill |

---

## Enabling Agent Teams

Add to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Or set in environment: `export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`

---

## Architecture

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Team lead** | Main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, coords |
| **Teammates** | Separate Claude Code instances working on assigned tasks |
| **Task list** | Shared task list teammates claim and complete (with dependency tracking) |
| **Mailbox** | Messaging system for direct inter-agent communication |

### Storage

| Data        | Location                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Team config | `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` |
| Task list   | `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`            |

Team config contains a `members` array with each teammate's name, agent ID, and type. Teammates can read this file to discover peers by name.

> **Runtime state — do not pre-author.** `config.json` is auto-managed runtime state (session IDs, tmux pane IDs, members). Hand-editing is overwritten on the next state update. There is also no project-level team config: a file like `.claude/teams/teams.json` is **not recognized** and Claude treats it as an ordinary file. Use `subagent` definitions (see below) for reusable team roles instead.

### Messaging primitives

| Channel | Target | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **message** | one teammate by name | Targeted follow-ups and handoffs |
| **one message per recipient** | one named teammate each | There is no broadcast channel. Reaching everyone means one `SendMessage` per teammate, so cost scales linearly with team size — use sparingly |

The lead assigns every teammate a name at spawn time. For predictable names you can reference in later prompts, tell the lead what to call each teammate in the spawn instruction.

### Permissions

Teammates inherit the lead's permission settings at spawn. You can change individual modes after spawning but cannot set per-teammate modes at spawn time.

### Context

Teammates load the same startup context as a regular session (`AGENTS.md` via the Claude runtime entry point, applicable rules, MCP servers, preloaded skills) plus the spawn prompt. The lead's conversation history does NOT carry over.

Because every teammate pays that startup cost, keep global context lean. Put only always-needed guidance in `AGENTS.md`, use path-scoped rules for persistent local guidance, and keep large task detail in the spawn prompt or on-demand references.

## Display Modes

| Mode | How It Works | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `in-process` | All teammates in main terminal. **Default.** | Any terminal |
| `auto` | Split panes when already inside tmux, or in iTerm2 with `it2`; in-process otherwise | - |
| `tmux` | Split panes, auto-detecting tmux or iTerm2 | tmux or iTerm2 |
| `iterm2` | iTerm2 native split panes explicitly (v2.1.186+) | iTerm2 with `it2` |

The default is `in-process`. Before v2.1.179 it was `auto`, so an upgraded session that used to open split panes now stays in one terminal unless the mode is set explicitly.

Configure in settings.json:

```json
{
  "teammateMode": "in-process"
}
```

Or per-session: `claude --teammate-mode in-process`

### iTerm2 split-pane setup

iTerm2 split panes require both pieces — missing either one silently falls back to in-process mode:

1. Install the [`it2` CLI](https://github.com/mkusaka/it2) (`npm i -g it2` or the upstream install script).
2. In iTerm2 preferences, enable **iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API**.

tmux is the alternative; `tmux -CC` inside iTerm2 is the recommended wrapper.

### In-Process Controls

| Key     | Action                                               |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Up/Down | Select teammate                                      |
| Enter   | Open the selected transcript and message it directly |
| Escape  | Interrupt teammate's current turn                    |
| `x`     | Stop the selected teammate                           |
| Ctrl+T  | Toggle task list                                     |

While viewing an in-process teammate, plain text and skills go to that teammate, but built-in commands still run in the lead's session. A teammate's model and fast mode are fixed at spawn, so `/model` and `/fast` only change the lead; `/effort` applies to the viewed teammate.

## Subagent Definitions as Teammates

When spawning a teammate you can reference any subagent type from project, user, plugin, or CLI scope by name (e.g. `Spawn a teammate using the security-reviewer agent type to audit the auth module`). This lets one definition serve as both a delegated subagent _and_ an agent-team teammate.

Behavioral contract when a subagent is spawned as a teammate:

| Field | Applied as teammate? |
| --- | --- |
| `tools` | **Yes** — allowlist/denylist honored |
| `model` | **Yes** |
| body (markdown) | **Yes** — appended to the teammate's default system prompt as additional instructions (not replacing it) |
| `skills` | **No** — ignored on the teammate path; teammates load skills from project/user settings like a regular session |
| `mcpServers` | **No** — ignored on the teammate path; teammates load MCP servers from project/user settings |

**Always-available team tools.** `SendMessage` and the task-management tools are available to every teammate **even when `tools` restricts other tools**. You cannot hide team coordination from a teammate by narrowing its `tools` list.

---

## Team Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Research Team

Best for: Multiple perspectives on the same problem.

```
Spawn 3 teammates to research the authentication refactor from 3 angles:
- One teammate on security implications
- One on performance impact
- One on backward compatibility
Have them share findings and challenge each other.
```

**Why teams > subagents here:** Teammates can directly challenge each other's findings rather than the lead having to manually relay contradictions.

### Pattern 2: Cross-Layer Feature Team

Best for: Changes spanning frontend, backend, database.

```
Spawn teammates to implement the user preferences feature:
- Frontend teammate: builds the settings UI
- Backend teammate: creates Server Actions and validation
- Database teammate: writes the migration and RLS policies
Have them coordinate on the API contract.
```

**Why teams > subagents here:** The frontend teammate can directly ask the backend teammate about the response shape without orchestrator relay.

### Pattern 3: Competing Hypotheses (Debugging)

Best for: Unknown root cause requiring parallel investigation.

```
Users report the app exits after one message. Spawn 5 teammates to investigate
different hypotheses. Have them talk to each other to try to disprove each
other's theories, like a scientific debate.
```

**Why teams > subagents here:** Adversarial debate between independent investigators produces stronger root cause analysis than anchored sequential investigation.

### Pattern 4: Code Review Panel

Best for: Thorough multi-lens review.

```
Spawn three teammates to review PR #142:
- Security reviewer
- Performance reviewer
- Test coverage reviewer
Have them each review and report findings.
```

---

## Prompt Patterns for Teams

### Spawn with Detailed Context

Teammates don't inherit conversation history, so include task-specific details:

```
Spawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: "Review the authentication
module at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling,
session management, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in
httpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings."
```

### Specify Models and Count

```
Spawn 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.
Use Sonnet for each teammate.
```

### Keeping the Lead Coordinating

There is no delegate mode or keybinding for this. When the lead starts implementing instead of waiting, the documented remedy is a prompt — see below.

### Wait for Completion

```
Wait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding.
```

---

## Task Sizing and Assignment

### Sizing Guidelines

| Size | Characteristics | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Too small | Trivial, <5 min work | Coordination overhead > benefit |
| Too large | Hours of work, no check-ins | Risk of wasted effort |
| Just right | Self-contained, clear deliverable (function, test) | Productive parallel work |

**Target: 5-6 tasks per teammate** keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign if someone gets stuck.

### Assignment Strategies

| Strategy | How | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead assigns | Tell the lead which task to give to whom | Clear division of labor |
| Self-claim | Teammates pick up unassigned, unblocked tasks | Autonomous operation |

Task claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions.

### Task Dependencies

Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, completed. Dependencies auto-resolve: when a task completes, blocked dependents unblock automatically.

---

## Plan Approval Flow

For complex or risky tasks, require teammates to plan before implementing:

```
Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.
Require plan approval before they make any changes.
```

### Flow

1. Teammate works in **plan mode**
2. Teammate finishes planning, sends **plan approval request** to lead
3. Lead reviews: **approve** (teammate exits plan mode, begins implementing) or **reject with feedback** (teammate revises and resubmits)

### Influencing Approval Criteria

```
Only approve plans that include test coverage.
Reject plans that modify the database schema.
```

## Best Practices

| Practice | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Give enough context | Include task-specific details in spawn prompt (no history carries) |
| Avoid file conflicts | Break work so each teammate owns different files |
| Start with research/review | Low-risk entry point for learning team coordination |
| Monitor and steer | Check progress, redirect failing approaches, synthesize as they go |
| Cleanup is automatic | The team config directory is removed when the session ends; the task list persists so resumed sessions keep their tasks |
| Shut down before cleanup | Shut down all teammates first, then clean up |
| Pre-approve common ops | Reduce permission prompt friction via permission settings |

### File Conflict Prevention

Same rule as subagent waves: no two teammates should edit the same file. Break work into file-disjoint units. If shared config edits are needed, designate one teammate as the config owner.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Teammates not appearing | A row that vanished after sitting idle is hidden, not stopped — idle rows hide 30s after the whole panel goes idle and reappear on the next turn; more than three idle collapse into one `N idle agents` row. Use Up/Down to select, or message the teammate by name |
| Too many permission prompts | Pre-approve common operations in permission settings |
| Teammates stopping on errors | Message them directly with additional instructions |
| Lead finishes prematurely | Tell it to wait for teammates before proceeding |
| Orphaned tmux sessions | `tmux ls` then `tmux kill-session -t <name>` |
| Lead implements instead | Tell it: "Wait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding" |

---

## Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| No session resumption | `/resume` doesn't restore in-process teammates |
| Task status lag | Teammates may forget to mark tasks completed |
| Slow shutdown | Teammates finish current request before stopping |
| One team per session | Clean up before starting a new team |
| No nested teams | Teammates cannot spawn their own teams |
| Fixed lead | Cannot promote teammate to lead |
| Permissions set at spawn | Cannot set per-teammate modes at spawn time |
| Split panes require tmux/iTerm2 | Not supported in VS Code terminal, Windows Terminal, Ghostty |

---

## Integration with Existing Patterns

### Combining with Wave Execution

Agent teams can incorporate wave-based execution from [parallel-agent-patterns.md](parallel-agent-patterns.md):

1. **Wave 1:** Database teammate creates migration
2. **Wave 2:** Backend + frontend teammates work in parallel on their layers
3. **Wave 3:** Testing teammate writes integration tests
4. **Wave 4:** Lead synthesizes and verifies

### Combining with Subagents

Teammates can spawn their own subagents with the `Agent` tool for focused subtasks. Two constraints apply: an in-process teammate's subagents run in the **foreground** — requesting a background one returns an error, because a teammate's background work cannot outlive the lead's process — and teammates cannot spawn teammates, since only the lead manages the team.

### Choosing Teams or Subagents

| Feature | Subagents | Agent Teams |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inter-agent messaging | Report to the caller only | Direct mailbox between teammates |
| Shared task list | Caller manages all work | Native shared list with self-claiming |
| Session independence | Within parent session | Fully independent sessions |
| Token cost | Lower; results summarized back | Higher; each teammate is a separate instance |
| Experimental requirement | No | Yes (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`) |

**Recommendation:** use subagents when only the result matters, and a team when workers need to share findings and challenge each other. Without the flag set, no team is created and no teammate is spawned or proposed — plan for subagents in that case rather than expecting a fallback.
